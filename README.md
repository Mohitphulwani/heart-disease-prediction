Predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using Logistic Regression and Python. Includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualizations for insights.
# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction** project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical features.  

The goal of this project is to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients early, enabling preventive care and better decision-making.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains patient records with attributes such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type
  - Blood pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting blood sugar
  - Electrocardiographic results
  - Maximum heart rate achieved
  - Exercise-induced angina
  - ST depression
  - Slope of ST segment
  - Number of major vessels
  - Thalassemia
- Target variable: `HeartDisease` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

*(Include link if using a public dataset, e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset.)*

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification  
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - ROC Curve & AUC

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and evaluation
